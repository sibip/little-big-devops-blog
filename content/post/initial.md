You are not supposed to read this blog. This is just the place for my private notes. Attempt to collect and preserve some knowledge (I guess) about of various tools and approaches which should be learn by me during this trip. My goal is learn how to create some small and useless but awesome cloud application and make the process of features planning, development and continuous deployment as cool as possible in today's world.

Look at the picture below. This is a last time when you see similar bullshit in this blog.
