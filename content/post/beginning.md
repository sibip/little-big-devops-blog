I do believe that project documentation is same important as a code. Probably more important in some cases. The code can be ugly and buggy or probably obsolete because 30 years left since the moment when it was created. But well written documentation still be the source of true and guiding star for those who have to support this code. Very often the understanding why developer had choose this instead that much more useful than code in appropriate commit. <br/>  Each repository have to contain a blog which continuously describe all steps and decisions which was taken during development, describe architecture, solutions and challenges on the moment when it was happens. Good to be possible to mark some posts or part of posts and generate 'public' documentation or releases blog for the end-users.
Right now I just play about "static site generator". Would to see what is good and bad with this kind of solutions. <br/> [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator was picked just by random. Almost random. I heard that it is fast and modern enough.
